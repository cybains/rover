Extract ONLY the requested keys from the job text. 
Rules:
- Use EXACT wording from the text when possible.
- If a field is not explicitly stated, return null (for scalars) or [] (for arrays).
- Keep arrays concise (max 8 items for lists, 10 for outcomes).
- Do not invent salaries, dates, or locations.
- JSON only, no markdown.

Key semantics:
- responsibilitiesList: concrete actions the role performs (verbs).
- requirements: qualifications/skills/experience needed to get hired.
- workHoursWindow: any stated time-zone overlap or hours expectation, e.g., "4-hour CET overlap".
- outcomesKpis: measurable results or success metrics if mentioned.
- summary_tldr: one sentence (<= 240 chars) plain English role summary.
